Jack-O-Lantern

Parts:

* COB [LED light](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807134620275.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.80.6a891802asZcih&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa)
* 22 ohm resistor
* USB-C breakout board
* Orange vellum paper
* 3D printed cube

The LED I have is rated 1W at 3V. I tried to power it with 5V and it got too hot too soon. So I added a 22 ohm resistor. The voltage is down to just about 3V and the current is about 90 mA. Not quite 1W but bright enough and the LED stays cool.

I used a USB C breakout board as the power suppy. It has a couple of 5.1K resistors to trigger 5V so that it'd work with a PD charger.

The cube is printed in 6 pieces and friction fit together. Then I glue a piece of orange paper inside to diffuse the light.
